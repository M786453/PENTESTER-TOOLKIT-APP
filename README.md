## Features

The app will include a range of tools that are essential for Web Application and Network Penetration Testing:

#### HTTP MONITOR

Allows users to monitor Http requests and responses in real-time, including the ability to view request and response headers, bodies, and parameters. 

#### SITE MAPPER

Allows users to create a map of a website's structure and links, either through automated crawling or user-directed exploration. 

#### REPEATER

Allows users to manually send customized Http requests repeatedly to a server. 

#### INTRUDER

Allows users to perform automated testing of web application vulnerabilities by performing various types of brute force attacks like sniper attack, pitch fork, cluster bomb etc. 

#### ENCODER: 

Allows users to encode and decode data using various algorithms like Base64, Hex, URL and HTML encoding. 

#### HASHER:  

Allows users to calculate hash values for data using various hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 etc. 

#### PING UTILITY:  

Allows users to test the availability and response time of a server or website by sending a series of ping requests. 

#### PORT SCAN

Allows users to scan a network for open ports, useful for identifying potential vulnerabilities. 

#### GOOGLE DORKING

Allows users to search the internet using advanced search operators and keywords, useful for finding hidden or sensitive information. 

#### HTTP SERVER

Allows users to set up a local Http server, useful for testing and development purposes. 

#### PRIVACY

Allows users to mask their identity and location while using the app, useful for preserving privacy and avoiding detection using proxies. 

#### NOTES

Allows users to save the notes or payloads for various attacks in one place for later use.
